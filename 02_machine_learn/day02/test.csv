For a given set of coordinates, your task is to return a ranked list of the most likely places. Data was fabricated to resemble location signals coming from mobile devices, giving you a flavor of what it takes to work with real data complicated by inaccurate and noisy values. Inconsistent and erroneous location data can disrupt experience for services like Facebook Check In.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eWe highly encourage competitors to be active on \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-v-predicting-check-ins/scripts\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003eKaggle Scripts\u003c/a\u003e.
